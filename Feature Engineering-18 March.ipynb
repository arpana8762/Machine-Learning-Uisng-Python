    "The **Filter method** is a technique used in feature selection to identify and remove less relevant or irrelevant features from a dataset before training a model. It works independently of the machine learning algorithm. Instead, it relies on statistical measures to evaluate the relationship between each feature and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Evaluation Criteria:** It uses metrics like correlation coefficients, chi-square test, mutual information, or ANOVA to rank features based on their importance.\n",
    "2. **Ranking:** Features are ranked individually based on their statistical relationship with the target variable.\n",
    "3. **Selection:** Features that do not meet a predefined threshold or rank are excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If you have a dataset with features like age, income, and region, and you want to predict spending habits, the Filter method may rank features like income and age higher than region, leading to their selection."

    "The **Wrapper method** differs from the Filter method in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dependency on Model:** Unlike the Filter method, the Wrapper method depends on a specific machine learning algorithm to evaluate feature subsets.\n",
    "2. **Subset Evaluation:** It assesses combinations of features by training and validating the model on each subset and selecting the subset that produces the best model performance.\n",
    "3. **Computational Cost:** The Wrapper method is more computationally intensive than the Filter method since it requires multiple iterations of model training.\n",
